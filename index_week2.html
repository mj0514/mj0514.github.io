			<p style = "font-size: 20;font-family: sans-serif;">
				Berners talks about the benefits of web and preservation of it. With the web, the companies and individuals can share information and resources with public without any inhibition. With such technology, people can have more freedom of speech in websites and possible to share variety of ideas with anyone. However, with such high freedom, we always need to be careful that anything can be on website even if it is inappropriate or false which can be very vulnerable. Therefore, there always need some rules and confirmation but the boundary of limitation is always difficult to decide.
